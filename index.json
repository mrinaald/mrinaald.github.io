My focus was on enabling multi-task learning within this architecture, i.e., training the model to handle diverse tasks like numerical reasoning and knowledge-based QA simultaneously.\nProject Highlights Framework Re-implementation: Adapted ToolkenGPT to work with Hugging Face’s Transformer-based Llama models. This required significant changes to the training, model, and inference pipelines to ensure compatibility and extensibility. Multi-task Learning Extension: Designed and implemented a new multitask training pipeline and model (MultiTaskFunctionLM) to support concurrent learning across multiple tasks. Experimental Research: Conducted experiments to evaluate task synergy and performance trade-offs in multi-task setups. This included analyzing the effect of joint-task training strategies. Evaluation \u0026amp; Benchmarking: Developed custom evaluation scripts for benchmark datasets such as GSM8K, FuncQA, and KAMEL, measuring model generalization and reasoning performance. Key Contributions: Rewrote core training and inference modules to support Hugging Face models (train_llama.py, inference_llama.py, model.py) Introduced a multitask model and training script (multitask_model.py, train_llama_multitask.py) Built dataset converters and evaluators for task-specific benchmarks (convert_data.py, eval_gsm8k_funcqa.py, etc.) Note: The multitask model is still under development and currently supports inference on only the primary task in a multi-task setting due to architectural limitations.\nTakeaway: This project provided hands-on experience in deep model engineering, multi-task learning, and LLM fine-tuning, while demonstrating how tool-augmented models can scale to support flexible reasoning across diverse tasks.\nAttributions: Image source: ToolkenGPT by Hao et al.

One domain where FL shows promising improvements over centralized ML solutions is in developing Recommendation Systems (RS), as they can learn faster to provide better recommendations to new users and for new items without taking data out of user devices. Training FL based RS on edge devices at large-scale comes with its own challenges where the numbers of users and items are indefinitely large. This paper introduces a novel model framework for FL based RS which employs a fixed size encoding scheme for items and users, which is independent of number of items/users, therefore memory efficient and well suited for RS in large-scale applications. The proposed framework is explored through a use-case of Next App Recommendation, which is shown to have comparable recommendation performance with much lower memory consumption compared with SOTA solutions.","tags":["Machine Learning","Federated Learning","Recommendation System"],"title":"Memory Efficient Federated Recommendation Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Details This project was done as part of the course CS731A: Blockchain Technology and Applications, in the Spring ‘19 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Sandeep Shukla, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.\nBrief summary of the work done in the project Decentralized Application (DApp) implemented using Ethereum Blockchain platform to keep patients’ and doctors’ data at a health center.

This application should be capable of handling multi-stream video feeds for different users within the network. The web application was hypothetically supposed to be deployed in the Faculty Building at IIT Kanpur which will allow faculty members to attend meetings online via the application.\nFeatures Peer-to-Peer Connection: We use peer-to-peer connection rather than server based relaying of video streams. The host server only sets up the connection between two or more clients. After the connection is setup, exchange of data among the peers does not involve the server. Platform Independent: The application doesn’t require the clients to install any software on their personal computer. They just need to login to the hosted website and the server handles setting up the connection and sharing communication protocols. Multiple Chatrooms: Every conference will be allotted a unique chat room id with which all the users can join the associated chatroom. Since there can be several conferences that might be hosted simultaneously in different rooms, the application allows initiating multiple chatrooms to run independent of the others.

A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we firstly explore Siamese Networks, a unique twin-network setting which is capable of checking how similar any two inputs are. The observed shortcomings of the model inspire us to explore a more robust model, Matching Networks, a neural network which uses recent advances in attention and memory that enable rapid learning. We then extend the models to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets in addition to the standard Omniglot dataset they are trained on to check their robustness and achieve promising results.\n","date":1543555800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543555800,"objectID":"a6c49f4b206a0de27d484a53b5894954","permalink":"https://mrinaald.github.io/project/one-shot/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T05:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/one-shot/","section":"project","summary":"Data Mining course project","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"One-Shot Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Details This project was done as part of the course CS335A: Compiler Design, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Subhajit Roy, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.\nBrief summary of the work done in the project Implemented an Ada to MIPS compiler using C++ as the source language of the compiler.

All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear.\nRecent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor.

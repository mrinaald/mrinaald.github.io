I have also developed a newfound interest in Federated Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) through my projects at Samsung R\u0026amp;D Institute India - Bangalore (SRI-B), and I am currently exploring these areas.\nBefore starting my program at UCSD, I was working as a Lead Engineer at SRI-B specializing in the fields of Machine Learning, Federated Learning, and Edge computing. I joined SRI-B shortly after earning my Bachelor’s (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from IIT Kanpur.\nThroughout my tenure at SRI-B, I have gained extensive experience across diverse projects, encompassing domains such as Machine Learning, Federated Learning, and Android app development. The majority of my projects lie in the domain of Federated Learning, where I have specialized in training machine learning models within the limited computational capacity of users’ edge devices. By adopting this approach, we have achieved significant advancements in preserving user privacy as their data remains securely on their devices, thus never leaving their possession. Notably, my research contributions within these projects have yielded patents and publications, which are detailed in the “Research Work” section.\nBefore my involvement with SRI-B, I gained valuable experience through an internship at Hike Pvt. Ltd., located in New Delhi, during the summer of 2017. Within this role, I focused on developing an Image Classifier capable of categorizing images into predefined classes. Apart from that, I actively contributed to the Humanoid Project at the Robotics Club of IIT Kanpur, primarily focusing on its Computer Vision modules. In addition, I have undertaken numerous projects in diverse machine learning domains, including One-Shot Learning, Real-time Sentiment Analysis, and Detecting Semantically Similar Questions, among others. For a comprehensive overview of my projects, please refer to the “Projects” section on the page.\n","date":1691625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1691625600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science degree at UC San Diego.\nMy broad fields of interest include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Human-Machine Interaction, and Robotics.","tags":null,"title":"Mrinaal Dogra","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Mohamed Akram Ulla Shariff","Parameswaranath Vadackupurath Mani","Barath Raj Kandur Raja","Mrinaal Dogra"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1691625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691625600,"objectID":"c9e120b3f726ada28e4629383ef8fa94","permalink":"https://mrinaald.github.io/publication/behavior-fl/","publishdate":"2023-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/behavior-fl/","section":"publication","summary":"Embodiments herein disclose methods and systems for identifying behavioural trends across users.

One domain where FL shows promising improvements over centralized ML solutions is in developing Recommendation Systems (RS), as they can learn faster to provide better recommendations to new users and for new items without taking data out of user devices. Training FL based RS on edge devices at large-scale comes with its own challenges where the numbers of users and items are indefinitely large. This paper introduces a novel model framework for FL based RS which employs a fixed size encoding scheme for items and users, which is independent of number of items/users, therefore memory efficient and well suited for RS in large-scale applications. The proposed framework is explored through a use-case of Next App Recommendation, which is shown to have comparable recommendation performance with much lower memory consumption compared with SOTA solutions.","tags":["Machine Learning","Federated Learning","Recommendation System"],"title":"Memory Efficient Federated Recommendation Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Details This project was done as part of the course CS731A: Blockchain Technology and Applications, in the Spring ‘19 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Sandeep Shukla, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.\nBrief summary of the work done in the project Decentralized Application (DApp) implemented using Ethereum Blockchain platform to keep patients’ and doctors’ data at a health center.

This application should be capable of handling multi-stream video feeds for different users within the network. The web application was hypothetically supposed to be deployed in the Faculty Building at IIT Kanpur which will allow faculty members to attend meetings online via the application.\nFeatures Peer-to-Peer Connection: We use peer-to-peer connection rather than server based relaying of video streams. The host server only sets up the connection between two or more clients. After the connection is setup, exchange of data among the peers does not involve the server. Platform Independent: The application doesn’t require the clients to install any software on their personal computer. They just need to login to the hosted website and the server handles setting up the connection and sharing communication protocols. Multiple Chatrooms: Every conference will be allotted a unique chat room id with which all the users can join the associated chatroom. Since there can be several conferences that might be hosted simultaneously in different rooms, the application allows initiating multiple chatrooms to run independent of the others.

A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we firstly explore Siamese Networks, a unique twin-network setting which is capable of checking how similar any two inputs are. The observed shortcomings of the model inspire us to explore a more robust model, Matching Networks, a neural network which uses recent advances in attention and memory that enable rapid learning. We then extend the models to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets in addition to the standard Omniglot dataset they are trained on to check their robustness and achieve promising results.\n","date":1543555800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543555800,"objectID":"a6c49f4b206a0de27d484a53b5894954","permalink":"https://mrinaald.github.io/project/one-shot/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T05:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/one-shot/","section":"project","summary":"Data Mining course project","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"One-Shot Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Details This project was done as part of the course CS335A: Compiler Design, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Subhajit Roy, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.\nBrief summary of the work done in the project Implemented an Ada to MIPS compiler using C++ as the source language of the compiler.

All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear.\nRecent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor.

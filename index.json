All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor. This project aims at using neural network techniques to learn the model of the quadrotor and to use them for syn- thesizing a controller for it.","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"0e756af394fa1f384472ff53185bf520","permalink":"https://mrinaald.github.io/project/nn_quadrotor/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nn_quadrotor/","section":"project","summary":"Developed Neural Network models to learn the physical model of Quadrotor, and","tags":["Robotics","Machine Learning"],"title":"Neural Network Based Modelling and Control of Quadrotor","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mrinaal Dogra","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

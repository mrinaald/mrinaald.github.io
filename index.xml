&lt;!-- &lt;/ul&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
The aim of the project is to develop a video conferencing web application. This application should be capable of handling multi-stream video feeds for different users within the network.
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Peer-to-Peer Connection&lt;/b&gt;: We use peer-to-peer connection rather than server based relaying of video streams. The host server only sets up the connection between two or more clients. After the connection is setup, exchange of data among the peers does not involve the server.
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Platform Independent&lt;/b&gt;: The application doesn’t require the clients to install any software on their personal computer. They just need to login to the hosted website and the server handles setting up the connection and sharing communication protocols.
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Multiple Chatrooms&lt;/b&gt;: Every conference will be allotted a unique chat room id with which all the users can join the associated chatroom. Since there can be several conferences that might be hosted simultaneously in different rooms, the application allows initiating multiple chatrooms to run independent of the others.

&lt;h2 &gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very computationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we firstly explore Siamese Networks, a unique twin-network setting which is capable of checking how similar any two inputs are. The observed shortcomings of the model inspire us to explore a more robust model, Matching Networks, a neural network which uses recent advances in attention and memory that enable rapid learning. We then extend the models to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets in addition to the standard Omniglot dataset they are trained on to check their robustness and achieve promising results</description>

Websites like quora provide a platform for Question and Answering across various subjects and fields. However, the websites also contain loads of similar questions which have different sets of replies although they seek same answer. We aim to develop an application which can detect whether two questions on quora are semantically similar. More formally we want a model which when given two questions q1 and q2 , gives
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 if question can’t be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 if question can be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
depending on whether the questions are similar in terms of meaning or not. The criteria for two questions
being semantically similar is that they seek same answer

&lt;h2 &gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
The physics-based models of the quadrotors are being used for a long time to synthesize their controllers. All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor. This project aims at using neural network techniques to learn the model of the quadrotor and to use them for syn- thesizing a controller for it.

  &lt;li&gt;Decentralized Application (DApp) implemented using Ethereum Blockchain platform to keep patients’ and doctors’ data at a health center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application allows a patient to maintain their medical data and reports securely using blockchain technology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients were given full control over their data, and only they had the power to grant access of their data to any doctor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application also supported appointment bookings, where a patient can book an appointment with a doctor one-week in advance.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The project aims to develop a video conferencing web application. This application should be capable of handling multi-stream video feeds for different users within the network. The web application was hypothetically supposed to be deployed in the Faculty Building at IIT Kanpur which will allow faculty members to attend meetings online via the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Peer-to-Peer Connection&lt;/b&gt;: We use peer-to-peer connection rather than server based relaying of video streams. The host server only sets up the connection between two or more clients. After the connection is setup, exchange of data among the peers does not involve the server.
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Platform Independent&lt;/b&gt;: The application doesn’t require the clients to install any software on their personal computer. They just need to login to the hosted website and the server handles setting up the connection and sharing communication protocols.
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Multiple Chatrooms&lt;/b&gt;: Every conference will be allotted a unique chat room id with which all the users can join the associated chatroom. Since there can be several conferences that might be hosted simultaneously in different rooms, the application allows initiating multiple chatrooms to run independent of the others.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very computationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we firstly explore Siamese Networks, a unique twin-network setting which is capable of checking how similar any two inputs are. The observed shortcomings of the model inspire us to explore a more robust model, Matching Networks, a neural network which uses recent advances in attention and memory that enable rapid learning. We then extend the models to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets in addition to the standard Omniglot dataset they are trained on to check their robustness and achieve promising results.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the websites also contain loads of similar questions which have different sets of replies although they seek same answer.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 if both questions cannot be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 if both question can be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;depending on whether the questions are similar in terms of meaning or not. The criteria for two questions being semantically similar is that they seek same answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The physics-based models of the quadrotors are being used for a long time to synthesize their controllers. All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor. This project aims at using neural network techniques to learn the model of the quadrotor and to use them for syn- thesizing a controller for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- This project was started as part of the course CS657: Information Retrieval, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. It was later continued beyond the course into my second undergraduate research project. --&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;This project was done as part of the course CS771A: Introduction to Machine Learning, in the Fall ‘17 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Purushottam Kar, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was done as an undergraduate project, in the Fall ‘17 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Purushottam Kar, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The project aimed at developing a user application to get time-mapped viewer sentiment while watching a video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The application input was the viewer’s webcam feed in real-time while watching the video and the output contained the emotion specified at regular time intervals throughout the duration of the video being watched.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The following set of six emotions were considered in the application: {Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attributions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created the diagram using &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.diagrams.net&#34;&gt;draw.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

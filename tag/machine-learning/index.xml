      <title>One-Shot Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- &lt;h2 &gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was done as a industrial software internship at Hike Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, during May ‘17 - Jul ‘17, the summer of my second year. --&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was taken as part of the Robotics club at IIT Kanpur during my first two years at IIT Kanpur. --&gt;
&lt;h2 &gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was started as part of the course CS657: Information Retrieval, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. It was later continued beyond the course into my second undergraduate research project. --&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;This project was done as part of the course CS685A: Data Mining, in the Fall ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very computationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we firstly explore Siamese Networks, a unique twin-network setting which is capable of checking how similar any two inputs are. The observed shortcomings of the model inspire us to explore a more robust model, Matching Networks, a neural network which uses recent advances in attention and memory that enable rapid learning. We then extend the models to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets in addition to the standard Omniglot dataset they are trained on to check their robustness and achieve promising results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;Websites like quora provide a platform for Question and Answering across various subjects and fields. However, the websites also contain loads of similar questions which have different sets of replies although they seek same answer. We aim to develop an application which can detect whether two questions on quora are semantically similar. More formally we want a model which when given two questions, gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 if both questions cannot be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 if both question can be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;depending on whether the questions are similar in terms of meaning or not. The criteria for two questions being semantically similar is that they seek same answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The physics-based models of the quadrotors are being used for a long time to synthesize their controllers. All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor. This project aims at using neural network techniques to learn the model of the quadrotor and to use them for syn- thesizing a controller for it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt; The project aimed at developing a user application to get time-mapped viewer sentiment while watching a video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The application input was the viewer’s webcam feed in real-time while watching the video and the output contained the emotion specified at regular time intervals throughout the duration of the video being watched.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The following set of six emotions were considered in the application: {Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attributions:&lt;/h3&gt;

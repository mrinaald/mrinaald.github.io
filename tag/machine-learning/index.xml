The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very computationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we firstly explore Siamese Networks, a unique twin-network setting which is capable of checking how similar any two inputs are. The observed shortcomings of the model inspire us to explore a more robust model, Matching Networks, a neural network which uses recent advances in attention and memory that enable rapid learning. We then extend the models to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets in addition to the standard Omniglot dataset they are trained on to check their robustness and achieve promising results</description>

Websites like quora provide a platform for Question and Answering across various subjects and fields. However, the websites also contain loads of similar questions which have different sets of replies although they seek same answer. We aim to develop an application which can detect whether two questions on quora are semantically similar. More formally we want a model which when given two questions q1 and q2 , gives
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 if question can’t be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 if question can be answered by the same answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
depending on whether the questions are similar in terms of meaning or not. The criteria for two questions
being semantically similar is that they seek same answer

&lt;h2 &gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
The physics-based models of the quadrotors are being used for a long time to synthesize their controllers. All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor. This project aims at using neural network techniques to learn the model of the quadrotor and to use them for syn- thesizing a controller for it.

The project aimed at developing a user-end application to get time-mapped viewer sentiment while watching a video. The input will be the real time viewer’s webcam feed while watching the video and the output will be an emotion specified at regular time intervals throughout the video. The following set of six emotions were considered in the application: {Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful}

      <title>Neural Network Based Modelling and Control of Quadrotor</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- &lt;h2 &gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was done as a industrial software internship at Hike Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, during May ‘17 - Jul ‘17, the summer of my second year. --&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was taken as part of the Robotics club at IIT Kanpur during my first two years at IIT Kanpur. --&gt;
&lt;h2 &gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was started as part of the course CS657: Information Retrieval, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. It was later continued beyond the course into my second undergraduate research project. --&gt;
&lt;!-- This project was done as part of the course CS771: Machine Learning Techniques, in the Fall ‘17 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Purushottam Kar, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. --&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;This project was done as an undergraduate project, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Indranil Saha, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brief summary of the work done in the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The physics-based models of the quadrotors are being used for a long time to synthesize their controllers. All such controllers work with the linearized model of quadrotor, thus becoming prone to errors in adverse situations because, in reality, the quadrotor models are non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown that these tech- niques are very efficient in learning non-linear functions. This motivates us to use them for learning the model of a quadrotor. This project aims at using neural network techniques to learn the model of the quadrotor and to use them for syn- thesizing a controller for it.&lt;/p&gt;
